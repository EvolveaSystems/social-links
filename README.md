##  About the project

  This is an open-source Linktree scheme to collect all your links and have it in one place.  Feel free to use this repository as a starting point for your Linktree.
  This project was inspired by [@Linktree](https://linktr.ee/s/discover/share-content/) and [@craftzdog](https://github.com/craftzdog/link-in-bio)
  ##### This Linktree has a twist- users always land on a custom VANTA background.
  ##### This was achived by separating light and dark random colors and push it into the VANTA object


## üöÄ Getting started
#### Step 1
Clone this repository
```bash

git clone https://github.com/ritmillio/linktr.zoltanfodor.dev.git <your-linktree-name>

```
#### Step 2
You will have 2 repositories, <strong>main</strong> and <strong>tailwindcss</strong>.
If you don't want to modify the design you can work directly in main repository, update it with your profile info, links, etc. If you want to make modifications you can follow these steps:
##### step 2.1 (tailwind)
 ```bash

git checkout tailwindcss

```
##### step 2.2 watch tailwindcss
 ```bash

npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch

```
Now you can add new tailwindcss classes to your linktree.
