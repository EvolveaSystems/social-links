This Linktree was inspired by [@Linktree](https://linktr.ee/s/discover/share-content/) and [@craftzdog](https://github.com/craftzdog/link-in-bio)

### This Linktree has a twist - users always land a custom VANTA background.

#### This was achived by separating light and dark random colors and push it into VANTA object

Feel free to us this repository as a starting point for your Linktree

For editing this Linktree you can use the tailwindcss branch

Tailwind hot reload - ``` npx tailwindcss -i ./input.css -o ./output.css --watch ```
